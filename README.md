# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the front-end side of a full stack app I built called Le Restaurant. I used React to create this. It interacts with the backend via API requests - both GET and POST requests are used. The code includes login functionality, adding items to order, booking tables and admins can view bookings on the site.
